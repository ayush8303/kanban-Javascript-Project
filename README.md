# Kanban Board Application 📋

This is a Kanban board application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to manage their projects using a visual board. The board consists of three columns: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed." Users can add, delete, and modify tasks, as well as drag and drop tasks between columns. The application uses local storage to persist task data between sessions.

## 🚀 Features

- Three columns to manage tasks: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed."
- Add new tasks to any column.
- Modify existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Drag and drop tasks between columns with smooth animations.
- Task data is persisted using local storage.

## 🌟 Getting Started

To use this application, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to launch the application.

## 💻 Usage

Once the application is loaded, you can begin adding tasks to any column. To add a task, enter a task description and click the "+" button .

To move a task from one column to another, simply click and drag the task to the desired column. The application includes smooth animations for the drag and drop functionality.

To modify a task, click the "pencil" icon and update the description.

To delete a task, click the "Delete" icon in the task details pane.

Task data is persisted using local storage, so your tasks will be saved between sessions. If you clear your browser cache or use a different browser, your tasks will not be saved.

## 🎨 Customization

You can customize the appearance of the Kanban board application by modifying the CSS styles in the `style.css` file. You can also modify the JavaScript code in the `index.js` file to add new functionality or customize the existing functionality.
